Employed Python and Stata to construct institutional investor networks, analyze the impact of network indicators on stock price collapses through panel data regression and explore the influence mechanism.

In this paper, the social network theory is used to construct an institutional investor network based on whether they hold the same stocks heavily. The impact of network indicators and stock price crash risk is explored through panel data regression, and the influence mechanism is explored.

The empirical results show that the scale and balance of the network and stock price crash risk show significant positive correlation, network density showed significant negative correlation with the concentration and stock price crash risk. This conclusion means that institutional investors network impact on stock price crash risk is not homogeneous, reflect the characteristics of the different structure of the indicators will affect stock price in a different way the possibility of a crash.

At the same time, through the test of mediating effect, this paper finds that there is partial mediating effect in most of the influences of information delay, that is, institutional investor network often influences the abnormal fluctuation of stock price through the medium of information transmission, and further influences the crash risk. On this basis, this paper further puts forward targeted policy suggestions in order to prevent the malignant influence of stock price crash more effectively.
